===============================================================================
This is the code for the latest revisions to the third version of Little 
Smalltalk. The source tree has been reorganized a bit, the Makefile is simpler, 
and the source has been adapted to work on modern Unix-like OSes such as Linux.

Development is sporadic, but ongoing. I hope to continue working on this for 
years to come, keeping it as small, simple, and elegant as possible.

As with the original version of LST3, you can use this code freely and without 
restriction of any kind. This is public domain, as granted by the original 
author, Tim Budd.

Experimentation to run LittleSmalltalk from Python (2.x and 3.x)
----------------------------------------------------------------

Makefile            Build dynamic library: liblst3.so
                    Build C image build: buildImage
                    Create systemImage from *.st sources from bootstrap directory

run_lst3_main.py    First step, just call mai function from Python with cffi

build_lst3_def.py   cffi definition for st.py
st.py               Run interpreter by calling C functions from Python
                    image_read function is written in Python

initial_build.py    cffi definition for initial.py
initial.py          Run image builder by calling C functions from Python
                    makeInitialImage and goDoIt are written in Python
                    To run: "env LD_LIBRARY_PATH=. python3 initial.py"
